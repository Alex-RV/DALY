# Elgoog
El Goog is a search engine inspired by Google Search engine that was made with Next.js, Tailwind & Vercelthat uses.
With one slight difference; you don’t exactly get the results you want.

So for example, if you type in Chess it will return checkers. 
If you type in "I am a bad person", it will return "I am a good person”
